# EPFL Machine Learning - Project 1

Machine Learning algorithm using Ridge regression and selected features to find the Higg's Boson in Kaggle competition: classify whether a data was an event of the Higg's Boson or not. 


### Prerequisites

Download training and testing set from Kaggle. 



## Running the project

Launch the run.py file.

INPUT: training and testing data in the same folder
OUTPUT: prediction of the classification of the test set
